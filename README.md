## Abstract
With the development of online platforms, people can share and obtain opinions quickly. 
It also makes individuals' preferences change dynamically and rapidly because they may change their minds when getting convincing opinions from other users.
Unlike representative areas of recommendation research such as e-commerce  platforms where items' features are fixed,  in investment scenarios financial instruments' features such as stock price, also change dynamically over time. 
To capture these dynamic features and provide a better-personalized recommendation for amateur investors, this study proposes a Personalized Dynamic Recommender System for Investors, PDRSI.
The proposed PDRSI considers two investor's personal features: dynamic preferences and historical interests, and two temporal environmental properties: recent discussions on the social media platform and the latest market information. 
The experimental results support the usefulness of the proposed PDRSI, and the ablation studies show the effect of each module.
